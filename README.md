# svg-background-colorize
Sass function to color a SVG background.

When dealing with SVG backgrounds, the only way you have to change its by using CSS filters. I'm trying to build this tool to simply pass and HEX color code and return the equivalent filter values.
Another workaround will be to use SVG native filters, more concretely the `<feColorMatrix>`, but it can give you some headache if you don't know exactly what you're doing.

This is a WIP.
